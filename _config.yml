          This project was done for our final year portfolio presentation, it is consisted of an NFT Minter + Front-end platform to buy the NFT
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          We started by exploring and figuring out which blockchain we wanted it to be on, we found that the <mark>Polygon Network</mark> is pretty fast and work on Ethereum and the fees were very low
          and it's adopted to a lot of NFT marketplaces, then we had to figure out which language to use to make our contracts and we found that <mark>Solidity</mark> was the primary language for making
          smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. For testing, compiling and migration we used <mark>Truffle JS</mark> and <mark>React</mark> for our front-end platform.
          this project has opened our eyes on how to blockchain works and how important this could be to future digital arts, we are very happy to explore these possibilities and be part of them
          we also had someone buy an NFT from us on our first hour of launch :) YAY

          I started this project as a way for learning <mark>JS</mark> We had a tight schedule so we couldn't complete it in time, but we learned about game physics and controls in JS!

          Bootcamp for learning game developement in C# and Unity
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          This was the first time I got in the programming world truely, it was a great experience, a 3 week bootcamp with teachers from different companies and schools that are experts in the game developement field!

          In the end of that 3 weeks period each of us had to develop a simple game and represent it to judges and explain the mechanics of the game, I have developed a clicker game where you can mine and purchase mining gear
          to increase your profit, it was pretty simple with simple mechanics but it was quite challenging at that time!

          University specialized on project based education
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          Starting as the first student of Holberton School in Tunisia, I was trying to find a suitable school for me to start in, I didn't like the old school universities in Tunisia.

          All of them were focused on giving the same outcome for students, making the next generation workers that don't have any ambition to experiment and try new things, the pace in Holberton
          School is kind of overwhelming in the beginning but overtime I have learned to organize the way I work and make it more efficient, the school is all project based and you have to learn
          new technologies by yourself and with your peers!
